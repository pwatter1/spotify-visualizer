# Spotify Visualizer

Spotify currently does not have a visualizer, so I plan to try and create one. 

## Technologies
Python <br /> PyQtGraph <br /> Numpy <br /> OpenSimplex <br /> Pyaudio <br /> Spotify API

## Goals
I'm currently exploring how I want to go about this. <br /> My first draft will be creating the visualizer with input from my computer's microphone. <br /> Then I want to be able to take input from an mp3 file. <br /> Then I hope to use a library to download mp3 tracks from Spotify. To do so I hope to connect an account with my GUI.

## How to run
Clone the repo and run 'python main.py'
