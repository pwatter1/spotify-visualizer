# Spotify Visualizer

Spotify currently does not have a visualizer, so I plan to try and create one. 

## Technologies
Python <br /> PyQtGraph <br /> Numpy <br /> OpenSimplex <br /> Pyaudio <br /> Spotify API

## Goal
I'm currently exploring how I want to go about this. My first draft will be creating the visualizer with input from my computer's microphone. Then I want to be able to take input from an mp3 file. Then I hope to use a library to download mp3 tracks from Spotify. To do so I hope to connect an account with my GUI.
